The script is used to convert engineering stress-strain curve to true stress-strain curve.

A ture stress-strain curve is often needed when we want to try a finite element analysis. Although there are some other methods to get an approximative curve from engineering stress-strain curve, the result is often above the true curve. And the method from Liu Bing-yu is suitable for us to get a more accurate curve and my script refers to his article.
